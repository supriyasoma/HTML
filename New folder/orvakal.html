    <p>Orvakal Rock Garden in Kurnool is probably one of the less explored beauties in Andhra Pradesh. Known for its natural rock formations, this garden's claim to fame apparently happens to be Bahubali. Yup, several scenes were shot here. But that's not why we recommend you to visit this garden. The rocks are rare silica and quartz formations and it is said that these rocks were formed by volcanic eruptions. You'll find a lake in the centre of the garden and it usually takes a little over an hour to explore this garden. You can go rock climbing or hike through the entire garden. 

        The other attractions at Orvakal Rock Garden (also known as Orvakallu) include boating in the lake, a cave museum, and an animal garden. This animal garden is home to several metallic animal installations which are larger than life-sized and kids are sure to dig them. AP Tourism has developed the park to make space for a restaurant (at the entrance), and there are cottages dotted across the garden. In the months of November and December, they also host a car festiva</p>
